# Basics

### How do I control the movement of a drone or plane?

You'll use a handheld radio transmitter (aka "radio", "TX"), which transmits control information via radio waves to a receiver (aka "RX") on the vehicle. That receiver then either a. controls motor movement directly, or b. connects to a flight controller which then controls movement.

### How do I learn to fly?

Get a little practice in a flight sim, or buy a plane or drone that's good for trainer use.
