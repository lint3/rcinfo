# FPV Systems

Digital or analog? Which digital system?

## Analog

[Analog Page](fpv/systems/analog/analog.md)

Pros: Lowest latency. Cheap hardware. No vendor lock-in.
Cons: Low quality picture.

## Digital

Pros: High quality video, actively being improved and developed
Cons: Everything costs more. More vendor lock-in.

### DJI

[DJI Page](fpv/systems/dji/dji.md)

DJI has the most advanced (and most tightly integrated) hardware and software on the consumer market. Take a look at a Mavic teardown for an example! Their FPV system can be used on non-DJI vehicles. Despite its high level of polish and quality, the downside is that you're very restricted as far as modifications and tinkering that you can do. I consider DJI to be the Apple of drones, for better or for worse.

Formerly SharkByte, this digital system was designed by Fat Shark and has now been spun off into Divimath I guess?
